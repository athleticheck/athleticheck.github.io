## Project Idea:
Ever since the transition to electronic medical record systems for athletic staff at university sports programs, a tremendous amount of time has been spent on recording athletesâ€™ data.  This is due to the fact that most record systems do not provide a user friendly interface and are not easily accessible by athletic trainers.  As a result, trainers often end up recording data during athlete visits and then copying the data into the EMS at the end of the day.  This process leads to wasted time and unnecessary repetition of information.  Previously conducted interviews and surveys with athletic trainers ranging from junior level programs to D1 sports across the country support this claim.  The collected data shows that trainers spend anywhere from 2-4 hours a day on documentation alone.  Unfortunately, the University of Hawaii's athletic program is not an exception.  Our group's solution to this problem is AthletiCheck, a website that creates an easy-to-use record system targeted at both the athletes and their trainers.  Each athlete will have a profile where their basic information will be stored.  On top of this, a comprehensive history of each visit with a trainer will be attached to their record.  The athletes will be able to view their own profile and comment on the recorded visits.  This functionality will be available to the trainers, as well as the ability to document new visits with athletes.  We hope that this site will reduce time spent on documentation, allow trainers to focus on actually treating the University of Hawaii's athletes.

## Developer Guide

First, [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install).

Second, go to [https://github.com/athleticheck/athleticheck](https://github.com/athleticheck/athleticheck), click the "Code" button, and download "athleticheck-master.zip" as a ZIP file. Once downloaded, unzip in local machine and open with JS IDE of choice.

Third, cd into the app/ directory of your local copy of the repo, and install third party libraries with:

```
$ meteor npm install
```

## Running the system

Once the libraries are installed, you can run the application by invoking the "start" script in the [package.json file](https://github.com/athleticheck/athleticheck/blob/master/app/package.json):

```
$ meteor npm run start
```

The first time you run the app, it will create some default users and data. Here is the output:

```
meteor npm run start

> meteor-application-template-react@ start D:\GitHub\athleticheck\app
> meteor --no-release-check --settings ../config/settings.development.json

[[[[[ ~\D\GitHub\athleticheck\app ]]]]]

### Note regarding "bcrypt warning":

You will also get the following message when you run this application:

```
Note: you are using a pure-JavaScript implementation of bcrypt.
While this implementation will work correctly, it is known to be
approximately three times slower than the native implementation.
In order to use the native implementation instead, run

  meteor npm install --save bcrypt

in the root directory of your application.
```

On some operating systems (particularly Windows), installing bcrypt is much more difficult than implied by the above message. Bcrypt is only used in Meteor for password checking, so the performance implications are negligible until your site has very high traffic. You can safely ignore this warning without any problems during initial stages of development.

### Viewing the running app

If all goes well, the template application will appear at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).  You can login using the credentials in [settings.development.json](https://github.com/athleticheck/athleticheck/blob/master/config/settings.development.json), or else register a new account.

### ESLint

You can verify that the code obeys our coding standards by running ESLint over the code in the imports/ directory with:

```
meteor npm run lint
```

### Collections

The application implements a 3 Collections: Profiles, Visits, and Comments. 

Profiles contains fields for username, firstName, lastName, imageURL, sport, age, height, weight, graduation (date), and major

The Profiles collection is defined in [imports/api/profile/Profiles.js](https://github.com/athleticheck/athleticheck/blob/master/app/imports/api/profile/Profiles.js).

The Profiles collection is initialized in [imports/startup/server/Mongo.js](https://github.com/athleticheck/athleticheck/blob/master/app/imports/startup/server/Mongo.js).

Visits contains fields for profileId, data, trainer, cleared, and description.

The Visits collection is defined in [imports/api/visit/Visits.js](https://github.com/athleticheck/athleticheck/blob/master/app/imports/api/visit/Visits.js).

The Visits collection is initialized in [imports/startup/server/Mongo.js](https://github.com/athleticheck/athleticheck/blob/master/app/imports/startup/server/Mongo.js).

Comments contains fields for visitId, date (Of visit), author, and comment.

The Comments collection is defined in [imports/api/comment/Comments.js](https://github.com/athleticheck/athleticheck/blob/master/app/imports/api/comment/Comments.js).

The Comments collection is initialized in [imports/startup/server/Mongo.js](https://github.com/athleticheck/athleticheck/blob/master/app/imports/startup/server/Mongo.js).

### CSS

The application uses the [React implementation of Semantic UI](http://react.semantic-ui.com/).

### Routing

For display and navigation among its four pages, the application uses [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/).

Routing is defined in [imports/ui/layouts/App.jsx](https://github.com/athleticheck/athleticheck/blob/master/app/imports/ui/layouts/App.jsx).


### Authentication

For authentication, the application uses the Meteor accounts package.

When the application is run for the first time, a settings file (such as [config/settings.development.json](https://github.com/athleticheck/athleticheck/blob/master/config/settings.development.json)) should be passed to Meteor. That will lead to a default account being created through the code in [imports/startup/server/Accounts.js](https://github.com/athleticheck/athleticheck/blob/master/app/imports/startup/server/Accounts.js).

The application allows users to register and create new accounts at any time.

### Authorization

Only logged in trainers (Application admin) can manipulate profile and visit documents. Users have read-only access to their own profile and none other.

### Configuration

The [config](https://github.com/athleticheck/athleticheck/blob/master/config) directory is intended to hold settings files.  The repository contains one file: [config/settings.development.json](https://github.com/athleticheck/athleticheck/blob/master/config/settings.development.json).

The [.gitignore](https://github.com/athleticheck/athleticheck/blob/master/.gitignore) file prevents a file named settings.production.json from being committed to the repository. So, if you are deploying the application, you can put settings in a file named settings.production.json and it will not be committed.

### Quality Assurance

#### ESLint

The application includes a [.eslintrc](https://github.com/athleticheck/athleticheck/blob/master/app/.eslintrc) file to define the coding style adhered to in this application. You can invoke ESLint from the command line as follows:

```
[~/athleticheck/app]-> meteor npm run lint

> meteor-application-template-react@ lint D:\GitHub\athleticheck\app
> eslint --quiet --ext .jsx --ext .js ./imports
```

ESLint should run without generating any errors.

It's significantly easier to do development with ESLint integrated directly into your IDE (such as IntelliJ).
